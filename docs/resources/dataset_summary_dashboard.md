# Dataset Summary Dashboard

Our dataset summary dashboard provides an overview and interactive summaries of the datasets currently available through CVD-COVID-UK/COVID-IMPACT within the secure Secure Data/Trusted Research Environments provided by NHS England for England, the National Data Safe Haven for Scotland and the SAIL databank for Wales. 
 
The dashboard can be used to explore the data dictionaries, data coverage and data completeness for each of the datasets provisioned in England, Scotland, and Wales. The datasets include those from primary and secondary care, COVID lab tests and vaccinations, deaths, critical care, prescribing/dispensing, cardiovascular and stroke audits, maternity services and mental health.
